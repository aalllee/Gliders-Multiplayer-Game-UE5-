# Gliders-Multiplayer-Game-UE5-

A Listen-Server Prototype Multiplayer Game built with Unreal Engine 5. Using Unreal's Steam Subsystem Plugin.
Each player flies around with a glider and tries to push each other off the platform by shooting projectiles.
 
In the game demo I play the game over two machines in separate countries controlling one with remote connection.
